
NAMES
    MODULES 
        hierarchical modules
        auto find which modules to import
	IMPORT
		public attribute
		import names form scope to scope (also selective) - import std (id, second), module2
	VAR
		check  chained assignments - are they var ? - no
		disallow chained assignments ? - clear without them, but disallowing them would be an exception (?)
		mutable variables - make remark when mutating variable not marked as var
			also, "x : Int" should allow later single assignment without remark (ie in if)
    remark multiply defined variables
	built-ins with qualified name (also overridable)

FUNCTIONS
	variable length fn params

IF
    eval if at compile time if needed to resolve ct values (ie types).
		note assigning in then or else branch to mutable type variable declared before if
	definite assignment

TYPES
	type variables
    type parameters
    type annotations
	type aliases / equality
	built-ins - TypeOf, Num-Text conversions

ARRAY
	array operations (empty, first, rest)
	text is array

INTERPRETER
	! on file without start, tokens position does not correspond real file (don't tokenize again)
	! user overridable struct functions - construct, destruct, clone, ...
	! ref
	! try catch
	  a = const 1 + 2    if const 1 + 2 then    const if 1 + 2 ... ?
	  a = var 1 + 2 ?
	  built-in for stack trace
	  built-in in for env
	  dynamic and static typing versions
	  contracts
	  finally / scope guars
	  anonymous scope ?

TOKENIZER
	! text hex escapes
	! text unicode escapes
	! unicode support in text/char
	  unicode support in identifiers
	  allow unicode operators as an option "option uniop"

PARSER
! remark file origin
	! parse comments
	! braces
	  ! allow braces everywhere
	  ! parse op dot in form a.(+)  a.(..)
	  ! how to parse 3.(14)   (3).14   (3).(14)   3.(m)   (3).m   (r).(m)  ? (also for hex nums)
	  ! remark redundant brace as in "(a)"
	  ! wrong braces ( a, ] b, [ c )  - also mind coma
	! test for braces
	! fix parse op crash "+ a"
	! fix crash when calling parseBracedExpList when current token is not brace
	! parse : and = as sequence in parse fn after main parse
	! decimal exponent (hex and dec)
	! cancel unclosed text on first line
	! when code text ends with single quote, is it char/text/error ?
	! better recovery parsing of incorrect code
		if w t e  |  if w ignore then t e  |  if w then t ignore else e  |  if w then t e ...
	  documentation comments
	  nested comment
	  custom brace op apply
	  variables in text "abc $variable 123"

PREPARER
  operators priority
  tail call
  
SYNTAX VALIDATOR
	syntax (todo - specify what exactly)
	indentation level
  
TYPE INFERENCE / CHECK
	report type errors
	report declared vs. inferred type discrepancies
	infer definite assignment
	infer value origin
	infer value destination
	infer possible values for variable
	infer on fn apply / op apply: throws, ...
	infer on fn pure, deterministic throws, modify global, ..
	
OVERLOAD
	overloaded functions
	overloaded built-in functions
formatter - configuration profiles
autofix formatting / syntax
cmd interactive - first version
call functions as members  of first parameter
