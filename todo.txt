
NAMES
    MODULES 
        hierarchical modules
        auto find which modules to import
	IMPORT
		import names form scope to scope (also selective) - import std (id, second), module2
	VAR
		check  chained assignments - are they var ? - no
		disallow chained assignments ? - clear without them, but disallowing them would be an exception (?)
		mutable variables - make remark when mutating variable not marked as var
			also, "x : Int" should allow later single assignment without remark (ie in if)
    remark multiply defined variables
	built-ins with qualified name (also overridable)

FUNCTIONS
	variable length fn params
	change parsing of array from fn apply to array value

IF
    eval if at compile time if needed to resolve ct values (ie types).
		note assigning in then or else branch to mutable type variable declared before if
	definite assignment

TYPES
	type variables
    type parameters
    type annotations
	type aliases / equality
	built-ins - TypeOf, Num-Text conversions

ARRAY
	array operations (empty, first, rest)
	text is array

INTERPRETER
	! on file without start, tokens position does not correspond real file (don't tokenize again)
	! user overridable struct functions - construct, destruct, clone, ...
	! ref
	! try catch
	  a = const 1 + 2    if const 1 + 2 then    const if 1 + 2 ... ?
	  a = var 1 + 2 ?
	  built-in for stack trace
	  built-in in for env
	  dynamic and static typing versions
	  contracts
	  finally / scope guars
	  anonymous scope ?

TOKENIZER
	remark unicode chars outside quotes


PREPARER
  operators priority
  tail call
  
SYNTAX VALIDATOR
	syntax (todo - specify what exactly)
	indentation level
  
TYPE INFERENCE / CHECK
	report type errors
	report declared vs. inferred type discrepancies
	infer definite assignment
	infer value origin
	infer value destination
	infer possible values for variable
	infer on fn apply / op apply: throws, ...
	infer on fn pure, deterministic throws, modify global, ..
	
OVERLOAD
	overloaded functions
	overloaded built-in functions
formatter - configuration profiles
autofix formatting / syntax
cmd interactive - first version
call functions as members  of first parameter
